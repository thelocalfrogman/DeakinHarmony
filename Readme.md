# Deakin Harmony Discord Bot

## To-do
Collaboration Hub proposal

1. A user submits a collaboration idea using a form from the bot, including:
    - A short description of the idea
    - The clubs they want to involve

2. Initial Notification
The bot posts the idea in the #ü§ùÔ∏±collaboration-hub channel, tagging or notifying the relevant clubs.

3. Interest Check via Reactions
    - Each invited club is encouraged to react to the message (e.g. ‚úÖ).
    - If at least one member from each invited club reacts, the idea is considered mutually acknowledged.

4. Formal Collaboration Channel Creation
Once all invited clubs have acknowledged interest, a dedicated private channel is automatically created under the Interclub Communications category for focused discussion and planning.

5. If No Action Is Taken
    - If one or more clubs don‚Äôt respond/react, the idea will remain in the #ü§ùÔ∏±collaboration-hub as a pending collaboration post.
    - It stays visible so others can revisit or show interest later.
